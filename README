Notes for Mac OSX
-----------------

Mac OSX ships with an old version of openssl. Install a newer version (use homebrew or something like that), and configure with that new one

$ ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2d/
$ make

of course, you need to replace that path with wherever your openssl is.
